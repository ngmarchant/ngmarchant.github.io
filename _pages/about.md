I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Artificial Intelligence](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/) 
group at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). 
I completed my PhD at the University of Melbourne under the guidance of [Ben Rubinstein](https://www.bipr.net) 
and [Rebecca Steorts](https://resteorts.github.io/) (at Duke University).

My research interests span machine learning and databases. 
Recently I have been working on identifying vulnerabilities and improving the robustness of machine learning 
in adversarial settings. 
I am also maintain an interest in data integration and statistical evaluation, which was the focus of my PhD.
