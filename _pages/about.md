I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Artificial Intelligence](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/) 
group at the University of Melbourne. 
Before that, I completed a PhD at the University of Melbourne under the guidance of [Ben Rubinstein](https://www.bipr.net) 
and [Rebecca Steorts](https://resteorts.github.io/) (at Duke University).

I research topics in machine learning and databases, including data integration, human-in-the-loop systems, and 
adversarial machine learning. 
I'm a strong believer in the benefits of reproducible research, and strive to release open source [code](/code/).
