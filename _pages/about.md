I'm a PhD candidate in the [Artificial Intelligence](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/){:target="\_blank"} 
group at the University of Melbourne, supervised by [Ben Rubinstein](https://www.bipr.net){:target="\_blank"} and 
[Rebecca Steorts](https://resteorts.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} (at Duke University). 

My PhD research applies statistical machine learning to problems in [record linkage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_linkage){:target="\_blank"}, 
including active labelling of ground truth and propagation of linkage uncertainty. 
More broadly, I am interested in human-in-the-loop machine learning systems, probabilistic graphical models, sampling 
and approximate inference.
I'm a strong believer in the benefits of reproducible research, and strive to release open source [code](/code/) 
where possible.
