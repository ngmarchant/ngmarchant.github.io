I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Artificial Intelligence](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/artificial-intelligence/)
group at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/).
I completed my PhD at the University of Melbourne under the guidance of [Ben Rubinstein](https://www.bipr.net)
and [Rebecca Steorts](https://resteorts.github.io/) (at Duke University).

My research interests span machine learning, security and databases.
Recently I have been working on identifying vulnerabilities and improving the robustness of machine learning
in adversarial settings.
I also maintain an interest in data integration and statistical evaluation, which was the focus of my PhD.
