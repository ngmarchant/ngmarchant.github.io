## Research code

I have contributed to the following libraries/packages, which were released alongside research papers:

* [`activeeval`](https://github.com/ngmarchant/activeeval) implements a generic framework for 
  pool-based active evaluation in Python.
  Given an unlabelled pool of test instances and a set of classifiers to evaluate, the framework coordinates the 
  acquisition of ground truth labels in order to estimate a performance measure, such as precision and recall.
  It includes an implementation of our adaptive importance sampling method [(Marchant & Rubinstein, 2021)](/publications/#marchant2021needle),
  which aims to minimize asymptotic variance of performance estimates.
  This approach can reduce labelling costs in important scenariosâ€”e.g. significant reductions can be expected when 
  the classes are severely imbalanced. 
  This occurs, for example, when evaluating record linkage/entity resolution systems.
  Scripts for reproducing experiments in the paper are available [`here`](https://github.com/ngmarchant/ativeeval-experiments).

* [`exchanger`](https://github.com/cleanzr/exchanger) is an R package that implements a Bayesian 
  model for entity resolution as proposed in [(Marchant, Rubinstein & Steorts, 2022)](/publications/#marchant2022bayesian). 
  The model adopts the Ewens-Pitman family of infinitely-exchangeable random partitions as a prior on the linkage 
  structure and features an improved hit-miss distortion model. 
  The package is partially implemented in C++ and scales to data sets of modest size (~10k records) without 
  blocking.

  The package is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/exchanger/).

* [`dblink`](https://github.com/cleanzr/dblink) is an Apache Spark package for distributed 
  end-to-end Bayesian entity resolution. 
  The package implements extensions to the `blink` model [(Steorts, 2015)](http://doi.org/10.1214/15-BA965SI) 
  as proposed in our [JCGS paper](/publications/#marchant2020dblink). 
  This includes integration of probabilistic blocking and a more efficient partially-collapsed Gibbs sampler. 
  An R interface called [`dblinkR`](https://github.com/cleanzr/dblinkR) is also available, in 
  addition to [scripts](https://github.com/cleanzr/dblink-experiments) for reproducing experiments 
  in the paper.

* [`oasis`](https://github.com/ngmarchant/oasis) is a Python implementation of the active 
  evaluation method proposed in our [VLDB'17 paper](/publications/#marchant2017search). 


## Other projects

I am the lead developer of the following open-source projects:

* [`clevr`](https://github.com/cleanzr/clevr) is an R package that implements functions for 
  evaluating link prediction and clustering algorithms.
  It is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clevr/).

* [`comparator`](https://github.com/ngmarchant/comparator) is an R package that implements 
  functions for comparing strings, sequences and numeric vectors for clustering and record linkage applications. 
  It is available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/comparator/).
